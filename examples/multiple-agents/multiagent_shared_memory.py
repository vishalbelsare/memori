Multi-Agent Shared Memory Example with Agno

This example demonstrates how multiple Agno agents can share the same memory
using Memori. The agents collaborate on tasks while maintaining a shared
knowledge base of conversations, decisions, and context.

Scenario: AI Product Development Team
- Product Manager: Plans features and manages requirements
- Developer: Implements technical solutions
- Quality Assurance: Tests and validates features
- Project Coordinator: Manages timelines and coordination

All agents share the same memory namespace for seamless collaboration.

Run: `pip install memorisdk agno` to install dependencies
